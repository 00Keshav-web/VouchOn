    <h1>Gift Cards vs Coupons: Which Is Better?</h1>
    <p><em>Published on September 3, 2025</em></p>

    <p>People often confuse gift cards and coupons, but they serve different purposes. Knowing the difference helps you choose the right option for yourself or as a gift.</p>

    <h2><a href="/index.html#cashback-scroll">Gift Cards</a></h2>
    <p>Gift cards are prepaid cards loaded with a fixed amount. They’re flexible, as the receiver can buy what they want within the card’s value.</p>

    <h2><a href="/cashback.html">Coupons</a></h2>
    <p>Coupons provide discounts, either percentage-based or flat-rate. They’re great for saving money instantly but usually come with conditions.</p>

    <h2>When to Choose Gift Cards</h2>
    <p>Gift cards are best for birthdays, festivals, or corporate gifting. They give freedom to the receiver without forcing a specific purchase.</p>

    <h2>When to Choose Coupons</h2>
    <p>Coupons are perfect for personal shopping. They let you cut costs on planned purchases like fashion, groceries, or travel.</p>

    <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
    <p>Both have their own benefits. Use gift cards when giving someone the freedom to choose, and use coupons when you want instant savings.</p>
